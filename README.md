# @ChristopherA’s Lists of High-Signal, Low Noise Links      

**A series of annotated lists of opinionated, high-signal but low-noise links on topics I care about.**

## Support My Advocacy Efforts

 > If you like my advocacy, my point-of-view, and my writing, as well as my travel to support local communities, my talks for those communities, and my work with organizations such as [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com), [Rebooting the Web of Trust](https://www.WebOfTrust.info), and the [W3C Credentials CG](https://w3c-ccg.github.io), I invite you to sponsor me.
 >
 > Plus, it's a way to plug into an advocacy network that's not focused on the "big guys". Most of the large corporations have full-time people representing their desires in the various standards orgs, making it hard for small companies and lone developers to fully participate. I work to represent smaller developers in a vendor-neutral, platform-neutral way, helping us all to work together.
 >
 > You can become a monthly patron on my [GitHub Sponsor Page](https://github.com/sponsors/ChristopherA) for as little as $5 a month; and your contributions will be multipled, as GitHub is matching the first $5,000! Alternatively, you can support my efforts by sponsoring [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com) and our vision of the open web via a monthly [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons) or with Bitcoin via our BTCPay contribution page, [Bitcoin contribution](https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com).
 >
 > But please don’t think of this as a transaction. It’s an opportunity to advance the open web, digital civil liberties, and human rights together. You get to plug into my various projects, and hopefully will find a way to actively contribute to the digital commons yourself. Let’s collaborate!

I do not make any claims to the copyright of links or the list of links of themselves, only to my expression, organization, and annotations of them. However, if you use these significantly for your own work, I'd appreciate the attribution and link to my original list and that you would share your own annotated list under a similar license.

## Status & Versioning

These lists are mostly for myself, my professional clients, and my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ChristopherA), as I've not found any bookmarking tool that quite does what I want. The content of these lists can change every day, and different sections will get more focus and attention, and thus evolve or even need major refactoring over time.

To make it easier to understand the status of any particular list, I use a modified form of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

| Version Revision | Description                                                  | Example |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| **Major**        | A significant reorganization of the previous edition, or even refactoring of content out to another list and thus a file name change. | 3.0.0   |
| **Minor**        | A significant new edition of this list is complete. A number of new links and annotations added, maybe minor sections reorganized,  and some old links filtered out.  I've likely moved on to ffocusing on a different list. <br />If you see that a list version was set to 0.3.0  few weeks ago, the list is probably pretty current. If that 0.3.0 was a few months or even years ago, I may have added links, but I've not reorganized them or filtered old ones out. | 0.2.0   |
| **Patch**        | Minor additions to the list. I've added some new links into the approriate section and have annotated them, but I've not reviewed or filtered the list a whole since the last **Minor** revision.<br /> | 0.1.3   |
| **Raw**          | Here is where I vary from classic [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Before I declare a new list is sufficient organized and annoted to be called 0.1.0, I will capture links and thoughts with little or no review or annotation. I may increment the least significant **Patch** level to let me know that this list may be ready for organization, annotation and filtering. | 0.0.1   |
| **Stub**         | An empty topic hashtag that points to other topics           | None    |

I only use this versioning approach for the individual lists. I do not use git release tags as they really don't work well for individual files inside a repo — only for a repo as a whole.
