# My Personal POV

**Most of the news has been about governments using cell phones & mobile apps to do #ContractTracing, but another important topic area is how we can create digital #ImmunityCertificates to allow people who have recovered from Covid-19 to leave quarantine, participate in the economic recovery, and to travel for work or family.**

# General News & Opinion
*(Most recent first)*

**There are ongoing debates in terms of whether immunity can be proven/tested for effectively:**

* Lipsitch, Marc (2020, April 13). Who Is Immune to the Coronavirus? [#News #Opinion, New York Times].
  * Retrieved from  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-immunity.html
  > KEY QUOTE: Among the many uncertainties that remain about Covid-19 is how the human immune system responds to infection and what that means for the spread of the disease. Immunity after any infection can range from lifelong and complete to nearly nonexistent. So far, however, only the first glimmers of data are available about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.

**But that hasn't stopped countries/consortiums from considering implementation of COVID Immunity Certificates, Passports or Credentials:**

  * Retrieved https://www.coindesk.com/covid-19-immunity-passport-unites-60-firms-on-self-sovereign-id-project 
  > KEYQUOTE: These digital certificates would be issued by health care institutions but controlled by the user and shared in a peer-to-peer manner…A common misconception is that self-sovereign means self-attested, which removes the need for governments and other authorities; trust in the issuer of the credential is critical"

* Roland, Denise; Gauthier-Villars, David (2020, April 12). Coronavirus ‘Immunity Passport’ Stumbles in U.K. [#News #Opinion, Wall Street Journal].
  * Retrieved from https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-immunity-passport-stumbles-in-u-k-11586705619
  > KEYQUOTE: The prospect is tantalizing. Immune workers could return to jobs. Health-care employees could go to work without fear of contracting the virus from the newly infected. People could visit elderly relatives again, confident they wouldn’t pass on the virus.

  > Other countries, including the U.S., also are considering the use of immunity passports. “This is something that’s being discussed,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, told CNN. “It might actually have some merit under certain circumstances.”

  > But antibody tests are challenging to develop.

  * Retrieved from https://unherd.com/2020/04/how-far-away-are-immunity-passports/.
  > KEYQUOTE: If you issue immunity passports on this basis, barely a third of the people you give them to will actually be immune. “There’s nothing peculiar about this statistically,” Kevin McConway, an emeritus professor of statistics at the Open University, told me. “It’s just Bayes’ theorem.” The likelihood of you having had Covid-19, if you’ve had a positive test, depends not just on the accuracy of the test but on the prevalence in the population you’re looking at.

  * Retrieved from https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/health/immunity-passport-coronavirus-lockdown-intl/index.html
  > KEYQUOTE: The idea of immunity certificates is "a really smart one," he said. "But as yet we're not going to bring them in because we don't know yet that the immunity is strong enough and there's still more science that needs to be done about the levels of immunity in people after they've had the disease.

**This white paper suggests 20-30 year olds could re-enter the economy. If such a move takes place it's inevitable that this population would need some sort of immunity credential to further participate/support elderly populations still under lockdown:**

  > KEYQUOTE: The paper argues that a young workforce release of this kind would lead to substantial economic and societal benefits without enormous health costs to the country. In this way, the nation might begin to move forward in the footsteps of the young. The paper’s key concept could in principle be implemented in other countries.

**Beyond issues of immunology, Peter Story argues that we need to be design toward "co-immunology":**
* Story, Henry (2020, March 29) Co-Immunology and the Web For a Healthier World [#Opinion, #Society, #Immunology, Medium].
  * Retrieved from https://medium.com/@bblfish/co-immunology-and-the-web-43379b46688e
  > KEYQUOTE: We thus have three levels of immunities: biological, psychological and social. One should perhaps add hyper-social for the relations between states, that have over the last century put in place institutions to reduce the calamities of war. Each of these depends on the other. The body’s immunity is improved by individuals learning to adopt hygienic practices; those are helped by quarantining policies at the local and international level. At each level communication is restricted but cannot be stopped: trade, especially for medical goods and food, must continue, while new processes are put in place further to limit the spread of this microscopically small virus.

# Law, Policy & Regulations
*(Most recent first)*

**Even if the antibody tests and immunity science are solved for, numerous legal impediments exist for such implementations between haves vs have-nots:**

* Greely, Henry T. (2020, April 10) Covid-19 ‘immunity certificates’: practical and ethical conundrums [#News #Opinion, StatNews].
  * Retrieved from https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/10/immunity-certificates-covid-19-practical-ethical-conundrums/. 
  > KEYQUOTE: The legal issues aren’t clear. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) may be the most relevant federal statute, but it is triggered only by a disability. Having a Covid-19 infection can be a disability, but can having a normal immune system, one without evidence of a prior infection, count as a disability? If so, how would the act’s “direct threat” exception apply? The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has issued some guidance for employers, saying that Covid-19 qualifies for the “direct threat” exception, but that deals with people who are infected or symptomatic, not those who might become infected.
 
  > Other federal and state statutory and constitutional rights might also be invoked, such as the Federal Rehabilitation Act, state statutes similar to the ADA or broad state anti-discrimination legislation, and federal and state due process, equal protection, and possibly right to travel guarantees.

**Though the antibody testing and immunity science is yet to be solved for, along with the legal implications, the technological architecture to make credentials, passports or such certificates work in practice is a reality today.**

# Implementations & Analysis

## Immunity Credential Technology

**Though Immunity Credentials could be implemented with legacy identity and digital credential technology, there are some real advantages to using the new self-sovereign identity architectures of W3C Verifiable Credentials standard and the emerging Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification. I am co-inventor and architect of this architecture, so I am biased*

**This is a the best primer on the topic of W3C Verifiable Credentials standard**

* Sporny, Manu (2019, January 23). #RWOT10 Verifiable Claims Primer [#Primer, Github, WebOfTrustInfo].
  * Retrieved from https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/verifiable-credentials-primer.md.
  > ABSTRACT: It is currently difficult to transmit credentials such as driver's licenses, proofs of age, education qualifications, and healthcare data, via the Internet in a way that is verifiable yet protects individual privacy.
  > Starting in 2013, the W3C Credentials Community Group started to work in earnest on solutions in this space followed shortly thereafter by the Rebooting Web of Trust Community and W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group. These groups, composed of 150+ individuals and organizations, are currently focused on the creation, storage, transmission, and verification of digital credentials via the Internet.
  > This document is a primer for those that want to learn about the Verifiable Credentials initiative, the use cases and ecosystem, a basic overview of the technology, and how to get involved.

**The specification created by the W3C CCG was approved as a "W3C Recommendation" so now is a full international standard. Maintenance, additions, changes, etc. are now back at the W3C-CCG for building consensus on updates to the spec.**

**This is the technical standard:**

* Sporny, Manu; Noble, Grant; Longley, Dave; Burnett, Daniel C.; Zundel, Brent (2019, November 19). Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 [#Implementation, W3C CCG].
  * Retrieved from https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/. 
  > ABSTRACT: Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries. This specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.

**This note shares the official use-cases used in the creation of Verifiable Credentials:**

* McCarron, Shane; Andrieu, Joe; Stone, Matt; Siegman, Tzviya; Kellogg, Gregg; Thibodeau, Ted (2019, September 24). Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 [#Implementation, W3C CCG].
  * Retrieved from https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/. 
  > ABSTRACT: A verifiable claim is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of information about an entity's background such as a name, government ID, payment provider, home address, or university degree. Such a claim describes a quality or qualities, property or properties of an entity which establish its existence and uniqueness. The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward possible future standardization and interoperability of both low- and high-stakes claims with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving digitally verifiable proof of attributes such as qualifications and achievements. The use cases in this document focus on concrete scenarios that the technology defined by the group should address.
 
 
### Implementations of Immunity Credentials

**I am co-chair of World-Wide-Web Consortium Credentials Community Group ([#W3C CCG](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/)), where a number of important credentials and identity specifications were nurtured to the point where they could be formalized into international standards. Most notably, the Verifiable Credentials specification is now a full "recommended" standard, and the Decentralized Identity specification is well on its way. Both of these standards are key architectures toward privacy design, in particular in the short term for #ImmunityCertificates.**

**The W3C CCG meets online via voice and IRC weekly on Tuesdays at 12noon ET, 9am PT, and 5pm CET. At several recent meetings we have had discussion on COVID-19 related privacy topics, and it looks like some standards around #ImmunityCredentials and #LocationPrivacy in particular will become official work items. Our meetings are open to the public, and are announced on our public mailing list.**

* W3C (ongoing). W3C Credentials Community Group

**There has some some discussion & collaboration between different in the #W3C CCG on what a #Covid19 Immunity Credential might look like using the #VerifiableCredentials standard.**

  * Thread (long) starts at: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Apr/0119.html

**Some specific implementations of Immunity Credentials in response to COVID-19 have begun:**

**The COVID Credentials Initiative is leveraging the #W3C DID and Verifiable Credentials specifications. It appears to be led by members of the Sovrin/Hyperledger Indy architecture and platform for Self-Sovereign Identity.**

*COVID Credentials Initiative**
  * Global, cross-sector community of organizations using digital identity as a way to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and reboot public trust [#Implementation, Covid Credentials].
    * Retrieved from https://www.covidcreds.com
    > The COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) is a collaboration of more than 60 organizations working to deploy verifiable credential solutions to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Our goal is simple, we want to enable society to return to ‘normal’ in a controlled, measurable, and privacy-preserving way.
    > The initiative is a direct response to the many calls for an ‘immunity passport,’ a digital certificate that lets individuals prove (and request proof from others) that they’ve recovered after testing negative, have tested positive for antibodies, or have received a vaccination, once one is available. By proving some level of immunity, individuals will be able to begin participating in everyday life again. 

**I'm less clear on the status of Bloom's implementation. I sounds like they may be using the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard, but they have not been active in the #W3C CCG community so I don't know.**

    > KEYQUOTE The Government is considering introducing immunity passports, so those who have had coronavirus can get back to work. Matt Hancock said he had a “very strong interest” in bringing in such a policy, after returning to work yesterday (Thursday) following his own spell of self-isolation with Covid-19. However, the Health Secretary said that it was “too early in the science of immunity” to be able to bring in a comprehensive scheme. He said: “We are looking at an immunity certificate - how people who have had the disease, have got the antibodies and therefore have immunity can... get back as much as possible to normal life.

    > That glimmer of hope has turned the conversation to the daunting challenge of when and how to reopen without setting off another cataclysmic wave of contagion. To do so, Italian health officials and some politicians have focused on an idea that might once have been relegated to the realm of dystopian novels and science fiction films. Having the right antibodies to the virus in one’s blood — a potential marker of immunity — may soon determine who gets to work and who does not, who is locked down and who is free.
